# Motion sensor testing for mobile browser

Quick test that checks if phone and browser support rotation and acceleration sensors.

Rotations and accelerations are displayed with numbers rounded to two decimals.

Visual representation by moving a ball (white div) on field (green div), either with absolute rotation values with x and y where values are clamped to +-29, or with relative values where speed is calculated from acceleration sensors (gravity included).
